# Food Safety Incidents Summarization #

LLM-based system for summarizing food safety incidents.

### Description ###

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, quickly extracting and summarizing essential information from large volumes of incident
reports is a vital requirement across many industries. LLMs (Large Language Models) are a great tool for this given their
proficiency in understanding and synthesizing text.

This report details an incident summarization system designed to automatically retrieve, preprocess and summarize the
announced incidents (i.e. border rejections and/or market recalls) that are of relevance to each FOODAKAI user.
Note that FOODAKAI is the commercial food safety intelligence offering of Agroknow.
